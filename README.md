# ICME2018_Occluded-Person-Reidentification_datasets
This project aims to release the datasets in the paper, [Occluded Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02792), in ICME 2018. There would be a brief introduction to the paper and three datasets, Occluded-REID, P-DukeMTMC-reID and PETHZ as follows. Besides, another dataset in the paper, Partial-REID, is released by [Partial Person Re-identification](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2015/html/Zheng_Partial_Person_Re-Identification_ICCV_2015_paper.html). 

## Introduction of Occluded Person Re-identification

### Abstract
Person re-identiﬁcation (re-id) suffers from a serious occlusion problem when applied to crowded public places. In this paper, we propose to retrieve a full-body person image by using a person image with occlusions. This differs signiﬁcantly from the conventional person re-id problem where it is assumed that person images are detected without any occlusion. We thus call this new problem the occluded person re-identitiﬁcation. Toaddressthisnewproblem,weproposea novelAttentionFrameworkofPersonBody(AFPB)basedon deep learning, consisting of 1) an Occlusion Simulator (OS) which automatically generates artiﬁcial occlusions for fullbody person images, and 2) multi-task losses that force the neural network not only to discriminate a person’s identity but also to determine whether a sample is from the occluded data distribution or the full-body data distribution. Experimentsonanewoccludedpersonre-iddatasetandthreeexisting benchmarks modiﬁed to include full-body person images and occluded person images show the superiority of the proposed method.

All the datasets are only allowed for non-commercial purposes.  If these datasets are used for research, please refer to the corresponding paper. 
This is the page for our paper Occluded Person Re-identification, to be appeared in ICME 2018. We are the first to propose the occluded person re-id task, as is illustrated below.
