# ICME2018_Occluded-Person-Reidentification_datasets
This project aims to release the datasets in the paper, [Occluded Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02792), in ICME 2018. All the datasets are only allowed for non-commercial purposes.  If these datasets are used for research, please refer to the corresponding paper. 
This is the page for our paper Occluded Person Re-identification, to be appeared in ICME 2018. We are the first to propose the occluded person re-id task, as is illustrated below.
